What is LESS (stylesheet language)
Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.

LESS (Leaner CSS) is a dynamic stylesheet language designed by Alexis Sellier. It is influenced by Sass and has influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass. (visit--> www.lesscss.org)

What is Sass? (Visit --> www.sass-lang.com)
Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a stylesheet language initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum.

Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes
1. The indented syntax
2. SCSS

Bootstrap Getting Started:
The HTML File
Since Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype, include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the correct character set:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>	
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
</html>

Keep in mind that Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first. Mobile-first styles are found throughout the entire Bootstrap library instead of in separate files.

To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, also add the viewport meta tag inside the 
<head> element:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

The width=device-width sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
   <title>Bootstrap for Mobiles</title>
   <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
   <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
   <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
