Text Links
A text link allows the programmer to create text that acts as a link, so that when it is clicked on by a user, it will transfer them to another web page. 

Example
<html>
<Title>
Welcome to Naresh i Technologies
</Title>
<Head>
<body>
<a href="http://www.nareshit.com">Goto NiT Application</a>
</body>
</html>

Target Page
The target page feature, allows a link to be created that when clicked on, will open a new browser window, so that the user will then have two windows in front of them, one, being the page with the link, and the other, the page the link went to. 

Example
<html>
<Title>
Welcome to Naresh i Technologies
</Title>
<Head>
<body>
<a href="http://www.nareshit.com" target="_blank">goto NiT App</a>
</body>
</html>

Picture Links
A picture link allows the programmer to create a picture that acts as a link, so that when it is clicked on by a user, it will transfer them to another web page. 

Picture Link
This tag allows you to make pictures into links. The tag looks like <A HREF="url">. The starting tag is <A HREF="url"> and the closing tag is </A>. Between these two tags is where you put the picture tag.
