ResultSet Enchancements:
========================
ResultSet enchancements are divided into 2 catefories:
1)ResultSet Types
2)Concurrency types

1)ResultSet types:
==================
There are 3 types of ResultSet:
1)public static final int TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY;
2)public static final int TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE;
3)public static final int TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE;

The above all ResultSet types are static members in java.sql.ResultSet interface.

1)TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY:
====================
it is a default ResultSet type and it is introduced in JDBC 1.0 version.
it allows only forward direction to iterate records in a ResultSet.
it does not support absolute position & relative position.

2)TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE:
=========================
it is introduced in JDBC 2.0 version
it allows both forward and backward directions to iterate records in a ResultSet.
it supports both absolute & relative positions.
it will not show changes made by others in a distributed database management system.

3)TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE:
=======================
it is introduced in JDBC 2.0 version.
it allows both forward & backward directions to iterate records in a ResultSet.
it supports both absolute & relative positions.
it will show changes made by others in a distributed database management system.

Example img in the same folder
in the above example,client1 updates the data in a database,immediately it will be shown in client2
because it is a SENSITIVE ResultSet and it will not be shown in client3 because it is a INSENSITIVE ResultSet.

By using ResultEnchancement feature we can perform the following operations on ResultSet.
1)Moving a cursor in a scrollable resultSet.
2)Updating records with methods.
3)Inserting records with methods.
4)Deleting records with methods.

1)Moving a cursor in a scrollable ResultSet:
============================================
java.sql.ResultSet
Methods:
public abstract boolean isBeforeFirst() throws SQLException;
			isAfterLast()
			isFirst()
			isLast()
=>the above 4 methods are used to check the cursor position.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

public abstract void beforeFirst() throws SQLException;
			afterLast()
public abstract boolean first() throws SQLException;
			last()
=>The above 4 methods are used to move the cursor

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public abstract int getRow() throws SQLException;

=>it returns row number

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public abstract boolean previous throws SqlException;

=>it returns true & moves the cursor to previous record if the previous record is present otherwise it returns false.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public abstract boolean absolute(int) throws SQLExcpetion;
public abstract boolean relative(int) throws SQLException;

rs.absolute(3);=>it moves the cursor from starting to 3rd record in forward direction.
rs.absolute(-3);=>it moves the cursor from ending to 3rd record in backward direction.

rs.relative(3);=>it moves the cursor from current position to 3rd record in forward direction.
rs.relative(-3);=>it moves the cursor from current position to 3rd record in backward direction.
