Directives:
==========
There are 3 directives in JSP.
1)page directive
2)include directive
3)taglib directive

1)page directive:
=================
Syntax:
------
<%@page ..........%>
 here ....... is the place we write Attributes.

Attributes:
===========
1)language="......"
here ....... is java (java is the default value for language.) 


2)import="........"
	here ....... is packages or interfaces

	The following packages are implicitly imported in JSP:
	1)java.lang package
	2)jakarta.servlet package
	3)jakarta.servlet.http package
	4)jakarta.servlet.jsp package

	Examples:
	=========
	1)<%@page import="java.sql.*"%>
	2)<%@page import="java.sql.*,java.time.*"%>(for multiple import u dont have to write two imports u can write like this)
	3)<%@page import="java.time.LocalTime"%>
	4)<%@page import="java.sql.Connection,java.sql.DriverManager"%>

3)buffer="........"
=> it is used to specify the buffer memory size.

4)autoFlush="......."
here ...... is true/false (true is default)

The above two attributes are used to manage buffer memory efficiently.
Example:
=======
<%@page buffer="8Kb" autoFlush="false"%>

5)errorPage="........"
=> it is used to specify url of an error page.

6)isErrorPage=".........."
here .......... is true/false(false is default)
