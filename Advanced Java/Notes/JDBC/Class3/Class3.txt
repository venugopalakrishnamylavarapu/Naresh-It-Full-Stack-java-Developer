by using odbc driver because odbc cannot understand java instructions.

To solve the above proble jdbc drivers were introduced.
There are four types of Jdbc drivers:
1)Type 1 Driver(JDBC Bridge Driver)
2)Type 2 Driver(JDBC Native API Driver)
3)Type 3 Driver(JDBC Network Protocol Driver)
4)Type 4 Driver(JDBC 100% Pure Java Driver)

There are two ways to connect Java Application to Database

Type 1 JDBC Driver(JDBC ODBC Bridge Driver):
============================================
Driver Class Name:
==================
sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver

this driver is a part of Java Software(JDK).

Type 1 Driver Architecture:
===========================
		Diagram

Type 1 driver functionality
===========================
It converts Java Instructions into Odbc understandable format.

Type 1 driver developed in C language.

Type 1 driver vendor is Sun Microsystems.

ODBC drivers also developed in C language.

Type 1 driver Advantages:
=========================
1)Only one driver that supports all Obdc enabled databases.

Type 1 driver Disadvantages:
===========================
1)Performanvce overhead since Java calls should go through via Jdbc & Odbc drivers.
2)It is a platform dependent.
3)Database client software needs to be installed on local system.

Note:Type 1 driver removed from jdk 1.8 onwards.

Type 2 JDBC Driver(JDBC Native API Driver):
==========================================
it is also called as Partly Java Partly Native Driver (or) Partial Java Driver.

Type 2 drivers developed in Native Languages and Java Language.

Native Languages are C & C++.

Type 2 Driver Class Name for Oracle Database:
============================================
oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
(package.subpackages.Class)

Type 2 driver class is a part of ojdbc6_g.jar file (or) ojdbc8_g.jar file in Oracle Software.

JAR(Java Archive) file location:
================================
c:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\jdbc\lib
