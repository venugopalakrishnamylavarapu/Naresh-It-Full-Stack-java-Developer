Deployement Location in Tomcat Web Server:
=========================================

http://localhost:8082/first/test

http      -->protocol

localhost -->Domain name

8082	  -->Port Number

first	  -->War Filename

test	  --><url-pattern> of a FirstServlet in web.xml

http:
====
HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

it transfers hyper text.
Hyper text means HTML text.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
it is used by browser and server to communicate on the web.

localhost:
=========
it is a domain name.
if the server is installed on the same computer then use localhost as a domain name otherwise 
use computer name as domain name.

8082:
====
it is a port number and it is used to identify the service.
Tomcat web server default port number is 8080.
JBoss(Wildfly) server default port number is 8080.
Oracle database server default port number is 8080.
WebLogic server default port number is 7001.

Open server.xml file from the following folder to change the port number.
C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.0\conf
in that open server.xml

<Connector port="8080">  --> change that to 8082
0 to 1023 Reserved Ports
1024 to 65535 Free Ports


http://localhost:8082   ---> URL(Uniform Resource Locator)
