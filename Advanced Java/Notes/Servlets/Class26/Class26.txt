Declaration rules to a source file(.java file)
===============================================
1)A source file can have only one public class.
2)A source file can have any number of non public classes.
3)If the source   file contains public class then file name
  must match with public class name.
4)if the source file does not contain public class then on naming restriction to a file name.

The java compiler generates .class file for every class in a source file

A class that contains the main() method can only be used to execute the program.

Steps to develop web appllications:
===================================
1)Create a web application folder structure.
2)Create and compile web application source code (Servlet program).
3)Write deployement descriptor(web.xml file).
4)Create a WAR(Web ARchive) file.

Web Application Folder Structure
