Http Sessions:
=============
In this session tracking method,client state information stored in server memory.

in this session tracking session id created by web container to recognize the client.

Here session id created & passed to client system by web container with login response.

Here sesssion id destroyed whenever logout request comes to server.

To implement this sesison tracking method we need one more session tracking method wither cookies
or rewriting.

There are two ways to implement this session tracking method.
1)Http Sessions with Cookies
2)Http Sessions with URL Rewriting

in this session tracking,to maintain session id either cookies or URL Rewriting required.

1)Http Sessions with Cookies:
=============================
in this session tracking method client state information stored in server memory in session variables.

in this session tracking method session id stored in client system in cookie variable.

in the above example,session id created by web container whenever login request comes to a server,
stored in a server memory,passed to client system with login response & stored in client system in 
cookie varible.

Here server will send session id to client system only one time with login response.

Here client will send session id to server system many times(second request onwards upto logout request).

by default sessions are vanished after 30 minutes in tomcat server.

Here it is possible to set the time interval by using setMaxInactiveInterval() method of HttpSession interface.

jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet
--------------------------------

Methods:

public abstract long getCreationTime();
public abstract String getId();
public abstract long getLastAccessedTime();
public abstract void setMaxInactiveInterval(int);
public abstract int getMaxInactiveInterval();
public abstract Object getAttribute(String);
public abstract void setAttribute(String,Object);
public abstract void removeAttribute(String);
public abstract void invalidate();
=>it is used to vanish a session id.

jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet
--------------------------------

method:
public abstract HttpSession getSession();
