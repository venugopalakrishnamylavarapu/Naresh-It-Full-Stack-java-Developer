/*so todays class is about Inheritance
 
 there was a small glimpse of inheritence when we discussed about object class
 
 Definition
 =========
 Aquiring the properties of one class into another class.
 
 ->if we want to perform inheritance we need to use either "extends" or "implements" Keyword.
 
Keypoints in inhertance
========================
1)We can hold a parent class Object with a parent class reference & with that
  reference we can ONLY parent class methods.
  ex:-
  ClassA obj=new ClassA();[ParentClass]

2)We can hold a child class Object with a parent class reference & with that
  reference we can call ONLY parent class methods.
  ex:-
  ClassA obj=new ClassB();[ParentClass]
 
3)We can hold a child class Object with a child class reference & with that
  we can call BOTH parent & child class methods
  ex:-
  ClassB obj=new ClassB();[ParentClass & ChildClass]
 
4)We CANNOT hold a parent class object with a child class reference .if we 
  are holding a parent class object with a child class reference we will be
  getting an compile time error
  



 
 
 The program of this will be in the inheritencepacks so check them
