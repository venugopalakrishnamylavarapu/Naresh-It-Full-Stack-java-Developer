 clone()   check the class50,50A,50B
 =======
 1.clone() is used to create similar kind of clone of an object.
 2.object cloning means creation of an exact copy of an object.
 3.it creates a clone for existing object and initializes all its fields with exact 
   same contents of the corresponding class object
 4.if we want to create a clone for our Class object our Class should be inheriting a 
   marker interface i.e Cloneable interface.
 5.Maker interface means an interface with no abstract methods or any variables.
 
 
 Understanding final keyword
 ===========================
 
 'final' variable
 ->if you make any variable as final,you cannot change the value of final variable(it will be constant).
 
 
 'final' method
 ->if you make any method as final,you cannot override it.Because they are not available to sub classes.So
   only overloading is possible.
  
  'final' class
  ->if you make any class as final,you cannot extend it.it means sub classes can't be created to final class
