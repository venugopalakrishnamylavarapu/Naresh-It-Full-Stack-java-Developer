What are the issues with JavaScript?
- Not Strongly Typed Language
       
            var x = 10;
            x = "John";

- Not Strictly Typed, It is explicitly strict.

            x = 10;            // valid

            "use strict";

- It is not an OOP language

- It supports only few features of OOP.

- It is hard to extend

- It will not support code level security.

- Google started a language called "AtScript" for Angular

- Microsoft have TypeScript

- Microsoft .NET  language  "C#"   Anders Hejlberg

- TypeScript  Anders Hejlberg


                                TypeScript
- It is strongly typed.
- It is strictly typed.
- It is an OOP language.
- It is built in TypeScript.
- It can directly interact with hardware.
- Less memory
- Faster
- Light Weight
- It is used in building large scale applications.

Note: Browsers can't understand TypeScript
        TypeScript is translated into JavaScript


                            TypeScript Architecture
1. Core Compiler
    - Core compiler translates the typescript code into mechine code.
    - core.ts          : It verifies the keywords
    - program.ts        : It verifies the program structure
    - parser.ts        : It is responsible for converting one type to another
    - checker.ts        : It is responsible for data type checking.
    - scanner.ts        : It is responsible for handling input.
    - emitter.ts        : It is responsible fo handling output.

2. Standalone Compiler [tsc.ts]
    - It transcompiles Typescript program into JavaScript.

3. Language Service [services.ts]
    - It provides pre-defined functions and values required for typescript.
    - Service is a pre-defined business logic.

4. TsServer [server.ts]
    - Hosting
    - Request and Response
    - TypeScript programs are hosted, compile and managed on server.

5. VS Shim [shims.ts]
    - It makes the typescript program cross platform.
   
    TypeScript Program => Compiler => IL Code => Shim => Managed Code

    - Managed code is suitable for all OS services.

6. Manage Language Service
    - It is the service suitable for all OS.
    - It is cross platform.
    - Platform neutral.
