                        Angular Application Architecture
1. Factory
    - It is a set for values and functions.
    - It uses single call mechanism.
    - In single call mechanism an object is created everytime when a
     function is required.

2. Service
    - It is a pre-defined business logic.
    - It comprises of set of factories.
    - It uses single ton mechanism.
    - Single ton creates an object for first request and uses the same
     accross all other requests.

3. Component
    - It comprises of presentation, styles and logic.
    - It is a template for desing and funcitonality.
    - Component uses services.
    - Markup is using HTML, styles by using CSS and logic with Typescript.

4. SPA Environment
    - Index is the startup page in SPA.
    - Index page uses components for presentation and functionality.
    - SPA is component based.

Ex:
1. Go to "app" folder
2. Customize "app.component.html"

<div class="container">
  <h1>Angular Shopping</h1>
</div>

3. Add styles in "app.component.css"

.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 500px;
}
h1 {
    padding: 20px;
    border:1px solid gray;
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 3px black;
    font-family: Arial;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background-color: yellow;
}

4. Index.html uses App Component by its selector name "app-root"

 <body>
    <app-root> </app-root>
 </body>


                          Application Flow

1. User Requests application from browser
            http://localhost:4200

2. It invokes "main.ts"

3. main.ts imports "AppModule" and bootstraps "AppModule".

Note: Bootstrapping is the process of converting the static library into
         dynamic. [Injecting => Compiling => Processing]

4. app.module.ts  imports all library required for project.

5.  app.module.ts will bootstrap the components that you want in index.html

6. Index.html  uses the bootstrap components by using selectors

            <app-login>
            <app-register>
            <app-root>
