1st tool in our course:
Junit: unit testing library for java programs

unit testing:
testing a piece of code or program

we develop a project and we should test that this project is working fine or not
then only we can move this project to production environment(go-live)

java project --- multiple java files, properties


functional testing --- end to end  the application or project is tested if working fine or not
This is done by QA or testing team

application or project contains the below functionalities
1.login
2. home page
3. account details
4. product or service details

functional testing -- testing is done for each of the above mentioned functionalities in this example
in functional testing, mainly functionality of each component is tested

regression testing-- this testing will be done if some new functionalities are added to application
the application should not get impacted

load testing or performance testing -- we check the performance of the application
example:
my application is giving result in 1 second if 100 users are logging at a time to my application

now my application is giving result in 1 minute if 10000 users are logging at a time to my application


unit testing --this is done by developer
developer writes the code and also do the unit testing
