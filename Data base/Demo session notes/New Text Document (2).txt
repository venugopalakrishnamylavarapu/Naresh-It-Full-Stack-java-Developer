							==========
What is Oracle?
		- it is backend tool / DB software.
		- we can design & develop backend applications.

What is Backend application?
		- is an application where we can store data / information
of a particular business.
		- endusers cannot interact with DB directly.if they want to interact
they need a db software is called as "DBMS".(database management system)

Where we want to use Oracle?
	- we can use databases in following applications are

		> banking applications
		> hospital management applications
		> educational application(university)
		> transport application
		> sales & production applications
		> HR management applications

Who want to learn Oracle?
		- any platform person

Ex: java,python,.net,php,DS,PowerBI,MSBI,Hadoop,AWS,Deveops,testing.....etc

What are the prerequisites for Oracle?
		- no 
===============================================================
session-1:					Topic-1 : DBMS
========					=============

What is Data?
============
	- it is a rawfact (i.e characters & numbers & symbol......etc)
	- data can not be predict.(no meaning)

	Ex:
			SMITH				1021
			WARNER			1022
			MILLER			1023

What is Information?
=================
	- processing data is called as "information".
	- is always provide meaningfull.
	
	Ex:
		  customer_name		customer_id
		  =============		==========
			SMITH				1021
			WARNER			1022
			MILLER			1023

What is Database?
================
	- it is memory. which is used to store the collection of inter-related 
data / information of a particular organization.

What is Inter-related data/ information:
=================================
	Ex:  SBI Oraganization

		DB name:  SBI_DB
						> Branches details
							> Dept details
								> Emp details
									> Customers details
										> ........etc
	Ex:
			no employees = no dept
			no dept = no employees

			no products = no customers
			no customers = no products

Types of Databases?
==================
	- there are two types of databases in real world.
			1. OLTP(Online Transaction Processing)
			2. OLAP(Online Analytical Processing)

1. OLTP:
=======
	- these databases are used for storing "day-to-day" transactional 
data/information.
	- for running business organizations.
	- OLTP databases are supporting "live operations"(insert,update,delete)
	- retrieving small data by using "select".
Ex: oracle,sqlserver,mysql,db2,..................etc

session-2:
========
2. OLAP:
=======
	- these databases are used to stored "historical data"(big data).
	- it can supporting "select" operation.
	Ex: Datawarehouse

What are Datastorage?
===================
	- datastorage is a place where we can store data/ information.
	- there are 3 types of datastorages:
				1) Papers & Books(Before computers)
				2) Flatfiles ( From computers) (ex: textfiles)
				3) DBMS (s/w)

Flatfiles:
========
	- data can be stored in files(with help Operating System).
	
Drawbacks:
==========
	i) Data redundancy
	ii) Data inconsistency
	iii) Data retrieval
	iv) Data integrity
	v) Data security
	vi) Data indexing

i) Data redundancy:
=================
	- data can be stored in multiple files.

ii) Data inconsistency:
===================
	- confusion data.
	- it occure when we have duplicate data.
			i.e no duplicates = no inconsistency

iii) Data retrieval:
===============
	- if we want retrieval the required data from a faltfile then we 
need to develop an application by using high level languages are
C,C++,JAVA,.NET.........etc

iv) Data integrity:
===============
	- data validations.

v) Data security:
==============
	- there no security in file data.

vi) Data indexing:
===============
	- files are not supporting data indexing mechanism.
what is index?
============
	- to retrieving the required data from datastorage as soon as possible
(fastly).

3) DBMS:
========
	- DBMS stands for "Database Management System".
	- it is a software which is used to manage and maintain data/information
in database memory.
	- by using DBMS we can perform the following operations are
				> creating database memory
				> creating tables
				> inserting data
				> updating data
				> selecting data
				> deleting data

	User <--------------->  DBMS s/w  <---------------------> Database memory

Models of DBMS:
==============
		1) Hierarchical Database Management System(HDBMS)
				Ex: IMS s/w (information management system)
		2) Network Database Management System(NDBMS)
				Ex: IDBMS s/w (integrated database management system)
Note:
=====
	- HDBMS,NDBMS are outdated models in real time.

		3) Relational Database Management System(RDBMS)
				i) Object RDBMS(ORDBMS):
					> data can be stored in table format
						- a table is nothing "rows and columns".
							- row / record / tuple
							- column / attribute / field
						- a row is nothing but group of columns.
					> completly depends on "SQL".
				Ex: oracle,sqlserver,mysql,db2,sybase,........etc
			
				ii) Object Oriented DBMS(OODBMS):
					> data can be stored in "objects".
					> completly depends on "OOPS" concept.
					> not depends on "SQL" so that we called as "NO SQL"
					databases.
				Ex: mongoDB,cassandra,.....etc

Advantages of DBMS:
==================
	- to avoid data redundancy
	- to avoid data inconsistency
	- easy to access data 
	- easy to manipulate data 
	- supporting data integrity mechanism
	- supporting data indexing mechanism
	- supporting data security
	- supporting "ACID" properties for transactions.
	- easy to retrieval the required data 
===============================================================
session-1(19-09-2022)			ORACLE19c
==================		==========
	- Oracle is a RDBMS(ORDBMS) product which was introduced by 
"oracle corporation" in 1979.
	- Oracle is used to store data / information of particular organization
permanently(i.e HD) along with security(Authorized).
	- The first version of oracle is "Oracle1.0" in 1979.
			Latest verson : Oracle19c
			Very latest version : Oracle21c
	- Oracle can deployee(install) in any platform such as "windows,linux,
unix,mac,solaries operating system etc".
	- Oracle is a platform (operating system) independent.

Types of Oracle19c software editions:
================================
	- there are two types of editions:

1. Oracle Express Edition:
	> is supprting partial features.
Ex: recyclebin,flashback,purge,partition tables....etc not supporting.

2. Oracle Enterprise Edition:
	> is supporting all features.
Ex: recyclebin,flashback,purge,partition tables....etc supporting.

==========================================================
https://www.oracle.com/in/database/technologies/
oracle19c-windows-downloads.html

		STEP1: DOWNLOAD
		STEP2: ZIP FOLDER
		STEP3: UNZIP / EXTRACT
		STEP4: FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING VIDEO

HOW TO INSTALLING ORACLE19c ENTERPRISE EDITION SOFTWARE?
=========================================================
Software & Hardware requirements for installation:
....................................................................................
	> Windows10 / 11
	> HD 1tb / SSD 260gb/520gb
	> Ram 2gb/4gb
	> Any microprocessor
	> oracle19c enterprise s/w

WORKING WITH ORACLE DB SERVER:
================================
	- once we installed oracle s/w internally there are two components are
installed in our system.
				1. Oracle client 
				2. Oracle server

1. Oracle client :
==============
	- by using oracle client tool we can perform the following 3 operations.
			step1: Connect to Oracle database server.
			step2: Send request to Oracle database server.
			step3: Getting response from oracle database server.

Ex: SQLplus(CUI),SQLdeveloper(GUI),Toad,PL/SQL developer.....etc

2. Oracle server:
==============
	- Oracle server is having two more subcomponents are;
				i) Instance
				ii) Database

i) Instance:
=========
	- it is a temporary memory.
	- this memory is allocating from RAM.
	- data can store temporarly.

ii) Database:
==========
	- it is a permanent memory.
	- this memory is allocating from HD.
	- data can store permanently.

Client - Server architecture:
=======================

NOTE:
=====
	- when a user want to work on oracle db server there are two steps 
procedures:
				step1 : Connect
				step2 : Communicate

step1 : Connect:
==============
	- when a user want to connect to oracle server then we need a db tool
is called as "SQLplus/SQLdeveloper/Toad".

step2 : Communicate:
==================
	- When a user want to communicate with oracle DB then we need a 
db language is called as " SQL".

SQLPLUS vs SQL:
===============

		SQLPLUS								SQL
		========								====
1. it is db tool which was						1. it is a db language which
introduced by "Oracle corporation".			was introduced by IBM.

2. it is used to connect to oracle server.	2. is used to communicate 
												with database.

3. it will work as an "editor" for 				3. will provide sub languages
writting & executing SQL queries.			are DDL,DML,DQL/DRL,TCL,
												DCL for performing some
												operations over database.

HOW TO CONNECT TO ORACLE SERVER:
==================================
> go to all programs
	> go to oracle_ora19home1
			> click on sqlplus icon
				Enter username	: system (default user)
				Enter password    : tiger (created at installation time)
				Connected.
Note:
=====
> username is not a case sensitive but password is case sensitive.

Connectivity problems:
===================
Problem-1:
=========
Enter user-name: system
Enter password : tiger
ERROR:
ORA-12560: TNS:protocol adapter error

Solution:
========
> go to services
	> go to oracleserviceORCL and click on it 
			> select startup type : Automatic
					> click on start button
							> click ok

Enter user-name: system/tiger
connected.

Problem-2:
=========
Enter user-name: system/tiger
ERROR:
ORA-28000: The account is locked.

Solution:
Enter user-name: \sys as sysdba (default username)
Enter password: sys (default password)
connected

How to lock / unlock a user in oracle:
===============================
syntax:
======
ALTER USER <USERNAME> ACCOUNT LOCK / UNLOCK;

EX:
ALTER USER SYSTEM ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

Problem-3:
=========
Enter user-name: \sys as sysdba (default username)
Enter password: sys (default password)
Error:

solution:
========
	Reinstallation s/w.

HOW TO CREATE A NEW USER ACCOUNT IN ORACLE SERVER:
====================================================
SYNTAX:
=======
CREATE USER <USERNAME> IDENTIFIED BY <PASSWORD>;

EX:
SQL> CREATE USER MYDB4PM IDENTIFIED BY 123;
User created.

NOTE:
=====
	- Every new user is called as a "schema" in oracle db server.whereas
schema is nothing but it collection of db objects such as "tables,views,
synonyms,procedures,functions,triggers,........etc".
	- Every new user is called as "dummy user"(i.e no permissions).so that
we need permissions from DBA(system) to connect to oracle server.

SQL> conn
Enter user-name: MYDB4PM/123
ERROR:
ORA-01045: user MYDB4PM lacks CREATE SESSION privilege; 
logon denied

HOW TO GRANTING CONNECT PERMISSION TO USER BY DBA:
====================================================
syntax:
======
GRANT <PRIVILEGE NAME>  TO <USERNAME>;

EX:
Enter user-name: system/tiger
SQL> GRANT CONNECT TO MYDB4PM;
Grant succeeded.

C

HOW TO CHANGE A USER PASSWORD:
=================================
SYNTAX:
========
ALTER USER <USERNAME> IDENTIFIED BY <PASSWORD>;

EX:
SQL> PASSWORD
Changing password for MYDB4PM
Old password: 123
New password: ABC
Retype new password: ABC
Password changed

SQL> CONN
Enter user-name: MYDB4PM/ABC
Connected.

HOW TO RE-CREATE A NEW PASSWORD IF WE FORGOT IT:
==================================================
SYNTAX:
========
ALTER USER <USERNAME> IDENTIFIED BY <NEW PASSWORD>;

EX:
Enter user-name: system/tiger
Connected.

SQL> ALTER USER MYDB4PM IDENTIFIED BY MYDB4PM;
User altered.

SQL> CONN
Enter user-name: MYDB4PM/MYDB4PM
Connected.

HOW TO VIEW USERNAMES IN ORACLE DB:
=====================================
SYNTAX:
========
SELECT USERNAME FROM ALL_USERS;

EX:
===
SELECT USERNAME FROM ALL_USERS;

HOW TO DROP A USER FROM ORACLE DB SERVER:
===========================================
SYNTAX:
========
DROP USER <USERNAME> CASCADE;

EX:
Enter user-name: system/tiger
Connected.

EX:
SQL> DROP USER MYDB4PM CASCADE;
=================================================================
22-09-2022:				Topic-3 : SQL
=========					===========
	- SQL is a db language which was introduced by IBM.
	- The initial name was "SEQUEL" later renamed as "SQL".
	- It is used to communicate with database.
	- SQL queries are not a case sensitive i.e we can write in upper / lower 
	case characters.
		Ex:
			SELECT  * FROM EMP;----executed
			select * from emp; -----executed
			SeleCT * From Emp;----executed
	- Every sql query should ends with a ";" .
	- SQL is having the following five sub languages are:

1. Data Definition Language(DDL):
=============================
	> create
	> alter
		> alter - modify
		> alter - add
		> alter - rename
		> alter - drop
	> rename
	> truncate
	> drop

New Features:
==============
	> recyclebin
	> flashback
	> purge

2. Data Manipulation Language(DML):
================================
	> insert
	> update
	> delete

New Features:
============	
	> insert all
	> merge

3. Data Retrieval / Query Language (DRL / DQL):
=======================================
	> select

4. Transaction Control Language(TCL):
=================================
	> commit
	> rollback
	> savepoint

5. Data Control Language(DCL):
===========================
	> grant
	> revoke
==================================================================
create:
======
	- is used to create a new database object in oracle.
		Ex: table,view,synonym,sequence,.......etc

How to create a new table in oracle:
===============================
syntax:
======
create table <table name>
(
<column name1> <datatype>[size],
<column name2> <datatype>[size],
.....................................................
);

Ex:
create table student
(
STID ..........
);

DATATYPES IN ORACLE:
=====================
	- is an attribute which is used to store what type of data into a specific 
column in a table.
	- oracle supporting the following datatypes are:

			i) number datatypes
			ii) character / string datatypes
			iii) long datatype
			iv) date datatypes
			v) raw and long raw datatypes
			vi) lob datatypes (large objects datatypes)

i) number datatypes:
==================
		1) int
		2) number(p,s)

1) int:
======
	- storing integer values only.
	
	Ex:
			Sno int  -----> convert ----> Sno number(38) (38 digits)
					==============
					int = number(38)	
					==============

2) number(p,s):
=============
	- storing integer and also float values.
		when we use:
				number(p) : store integer values only
				number(p,s) : store float values only

Precision(p):
===========
	- counting all digits including left and right sides digits from 
a decimal point in the given expression.

		Ex:
				56.23
				precision = 4

				0970.56
				precision = 6

Scale(s):
=======
	- counting the right side digits only.

		Ex:
			56.23
			scale = 2
			precision=4

			97095.541
			scale= 3
			precision = 8

		Ex:
				price number(7,2)
				===============
				from 0.0 to 99999.99
				
ii) character / string datatypes:
==========================
	- storing string format data only.
	- in DB string can be represent with '<string>'.

	Ex:
				Empname char(10)
				================
smith ---------> error
'smith' -------> allowed 
1021 -----------> error
'1021' ---------> allowed
			
							string format data 
										|
		characters only string		alphanumeric string
			     data 								data
		[ a - z (or) A - Z ]				[ a-z / A-Z , 0-9,@,#,$,%,&,_,...etc]
											
		Ex: 'smith','ALLEN',....etc	Ex: 'smith123@gmail.com','AGN086W',password,....etc

- these datatypes are again classified into two types:
			1. Non-unicode datatypes
					> char(size)
					> varchar2(size)
			2. Unicode datatypes
					> Nchar(size)
					> Nvarchar2(size)
			Here,
					"N" ---- National language

1. Non-unicode datatypes:
======================
	- storing localized data.(English language only)

char(size):
=========
	- it is a fixed length datatype(static).
	- 1 char = 1 byte
	- maximum size is 2000 bytes(2000 char's)

	Ex:
				Sname char(10)
				=============
	'hello'----> hello ----> 5 bytes/10 bytes----> 5 bytes wasted
	'hel'--------> hel -------> 3 bytes/10 bytes---> 7 bytes wasted
	'he' --------> he ---------> 2 bytes/10 bytes---> 8 bytes wasted

	- the main drawback of char datatype is wasted memory.

varchar2(size):
=============
	- it is variable length datatype(dynamic)
	- 1 char = 1 byte
	- maximum size is 4000 bytes

	Ex:
				Sname varchar2(10)
				=================
	'hello'----> hello ----> 5 bytes / 5 bytes----> 0 bytes wasted
	'hel'--------> hel -------> 3 bytes / 3 bytes---> 0 bytes wasted
	'he' --------> he ---------> 2 bytes / 2 bytes---> 0 bytes wasted

- the main advantage of varchar2 datatype is save memory.

2. Unicode datatypes:
===================
	- storing globalized data(all national languages)
	
Nchar(size):
==========
- it is a fixed length datatype(static).
- 1 char = 1 byte
- maximum size is 2000 bytes(2000 char's)
- the main drawback of Nchar datatype is wasted memory.

Nvarchar2(size):
=============
- it is variable length datatype(dynamic)
- 1 char = 1 byte
- maximum size is 4000 bytes
- the main advantage of Nvarchar2 datatype is save memory.

Long datatype:
============
	- it is a dynamic datatype.
	- it can store non-unicode & unicode char's.
	- 1 char = 1 byte
	- maximum size is 2gb.
	- a table is having only one long datatype column.

		Ex:
				Cname long
				==========
'smith'-------> allowed (5 bytes /2gb)

Date datatypes:
==============
	- storing date & time information of a particular day.
	- from '01-JAN-4712 BC' TO '31-DEC-9999 AD'
	- user not insert time then oracle db server will take 
	time is '12:00:00AM' (or) '00:00:00am' by default.

i) date:
======
	- storing date and time(optional) of a day.
	- oracle default date format is 'dd-mon-yyyy/yy hh:mi:ss pm'.
		Ex:
			'dd-mon-yyyy/yy hh:mi:ss'
			'23-sep-2022/22 17:40:22pm'
			  1    1      2         1   1    1 ---------> 7 bytes(fixed memory)


ii) timestamp:
============
	- storing date and time along with milliseconds.
	
	Ex:
		'dd-mon-yyyy/yy  hh:mi:ss.ms'
		'24-sep-2022/22  16:22:34.0000'
		1    1      2           1   1   1   4----------> 11 bytes(fixed memory)

RAW & LONG RAW DATATYPES:
============================
	- storing binary format data(01010011010100101001).
	- these datatypes are called as "binary datatypes" in oracle.
	- storing image file / audio file / video file inform of 010100101010100
	format.
			RAW ---------------> 2000 bytes
			Long Raw -------> 2 gb

LOB datatypes:
=============
	- lob stands for large objects.
			> Clob
			> NClob
			> Blob

Clob:
=====
	- character large object.
	- storing non-unicode characters in the form of 1 char = 1 byte.
	- maximum size is 4gb.

			> char(size)		-	2000 bytes (static)
			> varchar2(size)	-	4000 bytes (dynamic)
			> long 				-	2 gb (dynamic)
			> clob				- 	4gb (dynamic)


NClob:
=====
	- national characters large object.
	- storing unicode characters in the form of 1 char = 1  byte.
	- max. size is 4gb.

			> Nchar(size)		-	2000 bytes (static)
			> Nvarchar2(size)	-	4000 bytes (dynamic)
			> long 				-	2 gb (dynamic)
			> Nclob				- 	4gb (dynamic)

Blob:
====
	- binary large object.
	- storing image/audio/video file in the form 0100101010010 binary format.
	- max. size is 4gb

			> Raw			-	2000 bytes(static)
			> Long Raw	-	2gb (dynamic)
			> Blob			- 	4gb (dynamic)
