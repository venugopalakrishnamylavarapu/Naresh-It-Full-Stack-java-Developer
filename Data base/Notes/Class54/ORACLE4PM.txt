3. packages:
============
	- it is a collection of variables,stored procedures
and stored functions are stored in a single unit of
memory is called as "package".
	- by using package we can share the required 
sub programs(procedures and functions) to client 
application and importing that package into client
application for reusable of those sub programs.
	- by using packages we are implementing 
encapsulating and function overloading mechanisms.
	- to create a package in pl/sql then we should
create the following two blocks those are
		1. package specification block
		2. package implementation  block(body)

1. package specification block:
===============================
	- in this block we can declare variables,procedures
and functions.

syntax:
=======
create [or replace] package <package name>
is / as
<declare variables>;
<declare stored procedures>;
<declare stored functions>;
end;
/

2. Package implementation block(body):
======================================
	- in this block we can implement the logical 
code of procedure and function which was declared 
in package specification block.

syntax:
=======
create [or replace] package body <package name>
is / as
<implementing logical code>;
end;
/

How to call a SP from a package:
================================
syntax:
=======
execute <package name>.<pname>(values);

How to call a SF from a package:
================================
syntax:
=======
select <package name>.<fname>(value/(s)) from dual;

Ex:
create a package to bind multiple stored procedures
in a single pl/sql block.
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE PK1
  2  IS
  3  PROCEDURE SP1;
  4  PROCEDURE SP2;
  5  END;
  6  /

Package created.

SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY PK1
  2  IS
  3  PROCEDURE SP1
  4  AS
  5  BEGIN
  6  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('I AM PROCEDURE-1');
  7  END SP1;
  8  PROCEDURE SP2
  9  AS
 10  BEGIN
 11  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('I AM PROCEDURE-2');
 12  END SP2;
 13  END;
 14  /

Package body created.

OUTPUT:
=======
SQL> EXECUTE PK1.SP1;
I AM PROCEDURE-1
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL> EXECUTE PK1.SP2;
I AM PROCEDURE-2
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

EX:
create a package to bind variable,stored procedure
and stored function in a single unit of memory?

SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE PK2
  2  AS
  3  X NUMBER(10):=1000;
  4  PROCEDURE SP1;
  5  FUNCTION SF1(A NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
  6  END;
  7  /

Package created.

SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY PK2
  2  AS
  3  PROCEDURE SP1
  4  IS
  5  A NUMBER(10);
  6  BEGIN
  7  A:=X/2;
  8  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(A);
  9  END SP1;
 10  FUNCTION SF1(A NUMBER)
 11  RETURN NUMBER
 12  AS
 13  BEGIN
 14  RETURN A*X;
 15  END SF1;
 16  END;
 17  /

Package body created.

SQL> SELECT PK2.SF1(5) FROM DUAL;

PK2.SF1(5)
----------
      5000

SQL> EXECUTE PK2.SP1;
500
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

IMPLEMENTING FUNCTION OVERLOADING MECHANISM:
============================================
	- TO CHANGE NO.OF ARGUMENTS TO THE SAME FUNCTION IS 
CALLED AS "FUNCTION OVERLOADING".
	
		EX:	FUNCTION F1(X NUMBER,Y NUMBER);
				FUNCTION F1(A NUMBER,B NUMBER,C NUMBER);

EX:
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE PK3
  2  IS
  3  FUNCTION F1(X NUMBER,Y NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
  4  FUNCTION F1(A NUMBER,B NUMBER,C NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
  5  END;
  6  /
Package created.
		
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY PK3
  2  IS
  3  FUNCTION F1(X NUMBER,Y NUMBER)
  4  RETURN NUMBER
  5  AS
  6  BEGIN
  7  RETURN X*Y;
  8  END F1;
  9  FUNCTION F1(A NUMBER,B NUMBER,C NUMBER)
 10  RETURN NUMBER
 11  AS
 12  BEGIN
 13  RETURN A+B+C;
 14  END F1;
 15  END;
 16  /
Package body created.

SQL> SELECT PK3.F1(10,20,30) FROM DUAL;

PK3.F1(10,20,30)
----------------
              60

SQL> SELECT PK3.F1(10,20) FROM DUAL;

PK3.F1(10,20)
-------------
          200

NOTE:
SQL> SELECT OBJECT_NAME FROM USER_OBJECTS WHERE OBJECT_TYPE='PACKAGE';
SQL> SELECT TEXT FROM USER_SOURCE WHERE NAME='PK1';

HOW TO DROP A PACKAGE BODY:
============================
SYNTAX:
=======
DROP PACKAGE BODY <PACKAGE NAME>;

EX:
DROP PACKAGE BODY PK1;

HOW TO DROP A PACKAGE:
=======================
SYNTAX:
=======
DROP PACKAGE <PACKAGE NAME>;

EX:
DROP PACKAGE PK1;
==============================================================
TRIGGERS:
=========
	- it is named block similar to stored procedure but executed
by system automatically.

purpose of triggers:
====================
1. to raise user defined alerts along with security.
2. to control / restricted dml and ddl operations over database.
3. to implement business logical conditions.
4. to validating data
5. for auditing

Types of triggers:
================== 
		1. DML triggers
		2. DDL triggers(DB triggers)

1. DML triggers:
================
	- when we created a trigger object based on dml commands
(insert/update/delete) then we called as "DML triggers".
	- these trigger are executed by system automatically when
user perform dml operations on a particular table in database.

syntax:
=======
create [or replace] trigger <trigger name>
before / after insert or update or delete on <table name>
[for each row ] -----> use in row level triggers only
begin
<trigger body / statements>;
end;
/

Trigger events:
===============
Before trigger:
================
	- when we created a trigger object with "before" event then,
				first : trigger body executed
				later : DML command will execute

After trigger:
================
	- when we created a trigger object with "after" event then,
				first : DML command executed
				later : trigger body will execute

NOTE: both are providing same result / output.

Levels of triggers:
===================
	- trigger object can be created at two levels.
				i) row level triggers
				ii) statement level triggers

i) row level triggers:
=======================
	- in this level a trigger body is executing for each row
wise in a table so that we should use "for each row" statement.

EX:
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST;

ENAME             SAL
---------- ----------
SMITH           12000
JONES           35000
ALLEN           12000
WARD            68000

SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR1
  2  AFTER UPDATE ON TEST
  3  FOR EACH ROW
  4  BEGIN
  5  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('HELLO');
  6  END;
  7  /
Trigger created.

TESTING:
SQL> UPDATE TEST SET SAL=18000 WHERE SAL=12000;
HELLO
HELLO
2 rows updated.

ii) statement level triggers:
=============================
	- in this level a trigger body is executed only one time 
for a dml operation.

Ex:
SQL>CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR1
    AFTER UPDATE ON TEST
    BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('HELLO');
    END;
    /
Trigger created.

TESTING:
SQL> UPDATE TEST SET SAL=10000 WHERE SAL=18000;
HELLO

2 rows updated.

BIND VARIABLES:
================
	- these variables are working just like normal variables
to store values while inserting,updating,deleting data from a 
table.these are two types,

i) :NEW :
=========
	- when we insert a new row into a table those new values 
are storing in :new bind variable.

syntax:
=======
	:new.<column name>

ii) :OLD:
=========
	- when we delete old values from a table those old values
are storing in :old bind variable.

syntax:
=======
	:old.<column name>

NOTE:
=====
	- these bind variables are used in row level triggers only.

To raise user defined alerts along with security:
=================================================
EX:
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR1
  2  AFTER INSERT ON TEST
  3  BEGIN
  4  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SOME ONE INSERTED A ROW INTO YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!');
  5  END;
  6  /
Trigger created.

TESTING:
SQL> INSERT INTO TEST VALUES(1022,'AALEN',45000);---ALLOWED
SOME ONE INSERTED A ROW INTO YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!
1 row created.

	- in the above trigger we raised a user defined alert but 
not restricted a dml operation on test table.so we need to 
restrict a dml operation on test table then we use a 
statement is called as"raise_application_erro()".

EX:
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR1
  2  AFTER INSERT ON TEST
  3  BEGIN
  4  RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20478,'SOME ONE INSERTED A ROW INTO YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!');
  5  END;
  6  /

Trigger created.

SQL> INSERT INTO TEST VALUES(1023,'WARD',32000);--NOT ALLOWED
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-20478: SOME ONE INSERTED A ROW INTO YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!

EX:
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR1
    AFTER UPDATE ON TEST
    BEGIN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20478,'SOME ONE UPDATED A ROW IN YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!');
    END;
    /
SQL> UPDATE TEST SET SAL=28000 WHERE SNO=1021;---NOT ALLOWED     
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-20478: SOME ONE UPDATED A ROW IN YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!

EX:
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR1
    AFTER DELETE ON TEST
    BEGIN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20478,'SOME ONE DELETED A ROW FROM YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!');
    END;
    /

SQL> DELETE FROM TEST WHERE SNO=1022;---NOT ALLOWED
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-20478: SOME ONE DELETED A ROW FROM YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!

TRIGGER WITH ALL DML OPERATIONS:
================================
EX:
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TR1
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON TEST
    BEGIN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20478,'SOME ONE PERFORMING DML OPERATIONS ON YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!');
    END;
    /
TESTING:
SQL> INSERT INTO TEST VALUES(1023,'WARD',32000);--NOT ALLOWED
SQL> UPDATE TEST SET SAL=28000 WHERE SNO=1021;---NOT ALLOWED     
SQL> DELETE FROM TEST WHERE SNO=1022;---NOT ALLOWED
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-20478: SOME ONE PERFORM DML OPERATIONS ON YOUR TABLE.PLZ CHECK IT !!!

2. to control / restricted dml operations by using 
business logical conditions:
============================
Ex:
create a trigger to restrict all dml operations on test table 
on every monday?
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TRDAY
  2  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON TEST
  3  BEGIN
  4  IF TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'DY') = 'MON' THEN
  5  RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20569,'WE CANNOT PERFORM DML OPERATIONS ON MONDAY');
  6  END IF;
  7  END;
  8  /

Trigger created.

EX:
create a trigger to restricted all dml operations on a table
between 9am to 5pm?
