OPERATORS:
===========
	- operator are used to perform some operation on the given operand 
values.oracle supports the following operators are:

	i) Assignment operator	=> 	=
	ii) Arithmetic operators	=>	+ , - ,* , /
	iii) Relational operators	=>	< , > , <= , >= ,!=(or)<>
	iv) Logical operators	=>	AND,OR,NOT
	v) Set operators		=>	UNION,UNION ALL,
					INTERSECT,MINUS

	vi) Special operators	=>   (+ve) operators	      (-ve) operator
				       =============	      ============
				      IN 		      NOT IN
				      BETWEEN                 NOT BETWEEN
				      IS NULL	      IS NOT NULL
				      LIKE 		      NOT LIKE

i) Assignment operator:
====================
	- to assign a values to varibale / attribute.

syntax:
======
	<variable name / attribute name> <assignment operator> <value>

Ex:
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=7788;
UPDATE EMP SET SAL=50000 WHERE DEPTNO=10;
DELETE FORM EMP WHERE JOB='CLERK';

ii) Arithmetic operators:
=====================
	- to perform some mathematical operations like addition,
subtraction,multiple and division.

syntax:
======
	<column name> <arithmetic operator> <value>

Ex:
waq to display SQL> SELECT SAL OLD_SALARY,SAL+1000 NEW_SALARY
  2  FROM EMP;

OLD_SALARY 	NEW_SALARY
-------------------- 	----------------------
       800       	1800

Ex:
waq to display empno,ename,salary and annual salary of employees
who are working under deptno=10;
SQL> SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL BASIC_SALARY,
  2  SAL*12 ANNUAL_SALARY FROM EMP
  3  WHERE DEPTNO=10;

Ex:
waq to display employees salaries after increment of 10%?
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL BEFORE_INCREMENT,
  2  SAL+SAL*10/100 AFTER_INCREMENT FROM EMP;

Ex:
waq to update employees salaries with the increment of 5% who are
working as a "manager"?
SQL> UPDATE EMP SET SAL=SAL+SAL*0.05 WHERE JOB='MANAGER';

iii) Relational operators:
====================
	- to comparing a specific column values with user defined condition
in the query.

syntax:
======
	where <column name> <relational operator> <value>;

Ex:
waq to display employees who are joined  before 1981?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE<'01-JAN-81';
	
Ex:
waq to display employees who are joined  after 1981?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE>'31-DEC-81';

iv) Logical operators:
==================
	- to check more than one condition in the query.
	- these operators are AND,OR,NOT.

AND:
=====
	- it return a value if both conditions are true in the query.	

cond1	cond2
=====	=====
T	T	----> T
T	F	----> F
F	T	----> F
F	F	----> F

syntax:
======
	where <condition1> AND <condition2>

Ex:
waq to display employees whose name is "SMITH" and working as a "CLERK"?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='SMITH' AND JOB='CLERK';

OR:
===
	- it returns a value if any one condition is true from the given 
group of conditions in the query.

cond1	cond2
=====	=====
T	T	----> T
T	F	----> T
F	T	----> T
F	F	----> F

syntax:
=======
	where <condition1> or <condition2>

Ex:
waq to display empoyees who are working as a "analyst" or whose salary is 
more than 2000?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB='ANALYST' OR SAL>2000;

Ex:
waq to display employees whose empno is 7369,7566,7788,7900?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE
  2  EMPNO=7369 OR EMPNO=7566
  3  OR EMPNO=7788 OR EMPNO=7900;

NOT:
====
	-  it return all values from a table except the given conditional 
values in the query.

syntax:
======
	where not <column name>=<value> and not <column name>=<value>

Ex:
waq to display employees who are not working as a "clerk" and as a "salesman"?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE
  2  NOT JOB='CLERK' AND NOT JOB='SALESMAN';
