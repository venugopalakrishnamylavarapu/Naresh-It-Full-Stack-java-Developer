SUBQUERY:
==========
	- A QUERY INSIDE ANOTHER QUERY IS CALLED AS "SUBQUERY".
	- SUBQUERY IS ALSO CALLED AS "NESTED QUERY".
	- A SUBQUERY STATEMENT IS HAVING TWO MORE QUERIES THOSE ARE,
		I) INNER QUERY / CHILD QUERY / SUB QUERY
		II) OUTER QUERY / PARENT QUERY / MAIN QUERY
	- AS PER THE EXECUTION PROCESS SUBQUERY STATEMENT IS CLASSIFIED INTO
	TWO WAYS,
		1. NON-CORELATED SUBQUERY:
		===========================
			FIRST : INNER QUERY
			LATER : OUTER QUERY

		2. CO-RELATED SUBQUERY:
		=======================
			FIRST : OUTER QUERY
			LATER : INNER QUERY

SYNTAX:
========
SELECT * FROM <TN> WHERE <CONDITION>(SELECT * FROM......(SELECT * FROM .........));

1. NON-CORELATED SUBQUERY:
===========================
	i) SINGLE ROW SUBQUERY
	ii) MULTIPLE ROW SUBQUERY
	iii) MULTIPLE COLUMN SUBQUERY
	v) INLINE VIEW 

i) SINGLE ROW SUBQUERY:
=======================
	- WHENEVER  A SUBQUERY RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.	
	- CAN USE THE FOLLOWING OPERATORS ARE :
		" = , < , > , <= , >= , !="

EX:
WAQ T DISPLAY EMPLOYEES DETAILS WHO ARE EARNING THE FIRST HIGHEST SALARY?
	========================================
	||SUBQUERY = (OUTER QUERY + INNER QUERY); ||
	========================================

STEP1: INNER QUERY:
===================
SQL> SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP;

STEP2: OUTER QUERY:
====================
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL=(INNER QEURY);

STEP3: SUBQUERY =(OUTER QUERY + INNER QUERY)
==============================================
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL=(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP);

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY THE SENIOR MOST EMPLOYEE DETAILS FROM EMP TABLE?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE=(SELECT MIN(HIREDATE) FROM EMP);

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHOSE JOB IS SAME AS THE EMPLOYEE "SMITH" JOB?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB=(SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='SMITH');

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHOSE SALARY IS MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM
SALARY OF "SALESMAN"?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL >(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP 
         WHERE JOB='SALESMAN');

EX:
WAQ TO FIND OUT THE SECOND HIGHEST SALARY FROM EMP TABLE?
SQL> SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL<(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP);

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE EARNING THE SECOND HIGHEST SALARY FROM EMP TABLE?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL=
(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL<
(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP));

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE EARNING THE 3RD HIGHEST SALARY FROM EMP TABLE?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL=
  2  (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL<
  3  (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL<
  4  (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP)));

		Nth	N+1
		===	===
		1ST	2Q
		2ND	3Q
		3RD	4Q
	
	
	
	
		30TH	31Q
	
	
	
		150TH	151Q

HOW TO OVERCOME THE ABOVE PROBLEM?
======================================
MULTIPLE ROW SUBQUERY:
========================
	- WHEN A SUBQUERY RETURN MORE THAN ONE VALUE IS CALLED AS "MRSQ".
	- WE CAN USE THE FOLLOWING OPERATORS ARE "IN,ANY,ALL".

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHOSE EMPLOYEE JOB IS SAME AS THE EMPLOYEE
"SMITH" OR "MARTIN" JOBS?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB IN(SELECT JOB FROM EMP
  2  WHERE ENAME='SMITH' OR ENAME='MARTIN');
			(OR)
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB IN(SELECT JOB FROM EMP
  2  WHERE ENAME IN('SMITH','MARTIN'));

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE EARNING MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM SALARY
FROM EMP TABLE?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL IN
  2  (SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP
  3  UNION
  4  SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP
  5  );

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE GETTING MAXIMUM SALARY FROM EACH JOB
WISE?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL IN(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP
         GROUP BY JOB);

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY THE SENIOR MOST EMPLOYEES FROM EACH DEPTNO WISE?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE IN(SELECT MIN(HIREDATE)
  2  FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO);

WORKING WITH "ANY" , "ALL" OPERATORS:
=====================================
ANY :
=====
	- IT RETURNS "TRUE" IF ANY ONE VALUE IS SATISFIED IN THE LIST WITH THE GIVEN VALUE.
	
	EX: 
	i) X > ANY(10,20,30)
		IF X=40 ------> TRUE
		IF X=08 ------> FALSE
		IF X=25 ------> TRUE

ALL:
====
	- IT RETURNS "TRUE" IF ALL VALUES ARE SATISFIED IN THE LIST WITH THE GIVEN VALUE.
	
	EX: 
	i) X > ALL(10,20,30)
		IF X=40 ------> TRUE
		IF X=08 ------> FALSE
		IF X=25 ------> FALSE

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHOSE SALARY IS MORE THAN ANY ONE "SALESMAN"
SALARY?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL >ANY(SELECT SAL FROM EMP
          WHERE JOB='SALESMAN');

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEES WHOSE SALARY IS MORE THAN ALL "SALESMAN"
SALARIES?
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL >ALL(SELECT SAL FROM EMP
          WHERE JOB='SALESMAN');
